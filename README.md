# Daily Market Price Forecast
## Summary
This Masterâ€™s degree final project is a study about the forecast of the Electricity Market Price.<br>

Electricity prices in Europe are set on a daily basis (every day of the year) at 12 noon, for the twenty-four hours of the following day, in what is refered to as the Daily Market. The price and volume of energy over a specific hour are determined by the point at which the supply and demand curves meet, according to the marginal pricing model adopted by the EU. The complete information about the Electricity Market is available [here](http://www.omie.es/inicio/mercados-y-productos/mercado-electricidad/nuestros-mercados-de-electricidad).<br>

#### Aim
The aim of this repository is to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the Daily Market Price for 48 hours Forecast Horizon.

## Technologies
The technologies used to develop this model are:<br>
* Python: I have applied this programming language to do the web scraping process, the data processing and the files of the web application.

Python for the Exploratory Data Analysis and the modeling phase. Jupyter Notebooks were used as first exploration to the data and to the model hyperparametrizations over the sample data set and Spyder IDE for source code implementation. Python was also used to deploy prediction system as API. Anaconda distribution was used for creating workflows and keeping the dependencies separated out.
Tableau for visualization main results of the models.
