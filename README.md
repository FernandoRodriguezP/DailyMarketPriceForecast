# Daily Market Price Forecast
## Summary
This Masterâ€™s degree final project is a study about the forecast of the Electricity Market Price.<br><br>
Electricity prices in Europe are set on a daily basis (every day of the year) at 12 noon, for the twenty-four hours of the following day, in what is refered to as the Daily Market. The price and volume of energy over a specific hour are determined by the point at which the supply and demand curves meet, according to the marginal pricing model adopted by the EU. The complete information about the Electricity Market is available [here](http://www.omie.es/inicio/mercados-y-productos/mercado-electricidad/nuestros-mercados-de-electricidad).
